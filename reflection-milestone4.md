# Game Sales Dashboard

## Reflection

Designing a rough sketch and implementing it from scratch to a full-blown dashboard has been an informative experience. As a team we were able to leverage our different backgrounds to design and implement an informative dashboard geared towards newcomers and investors in the gaming industry.

Our Game Sales Dashboard consists of four plots with the aim of aiding gaming industry stakeholders to gain insights by quickly scanning industry sales data. The plots we implemented are as follows:

   - The first chart shows the sales trend across various regions.  The chart has the capability to filter by video game genre, which makes it useful to see the evolution and the sales performance of a specific genre over time and across markets.

   - The second chart isolates the evolution of sales per genre and per region, this plot does not show comparisons. The purpose of this plot is to make it easier for the user to spot specific trends in the market, i.e the evolution of sales of Racing Games in Japan.

   - The third chart displays the ranking of video game publishers by copies sold. This bar plot allows to change ranking size by using a slider, the chart is useful to check which publishers are dominant in the industry.

   - The fourth chart shows the ranking of platforms by game copies sold. It shows how successful a video game manufacturer has been in terms of of games sold by console.

We have confirmed that the back end  functionality of the dashboard is correct, all the charts work correctly as we envisioned at the beginning of the project, all the selections are responsive.  A future improvement to our dashboard that has not been implemented in this project is a world map of video game sales that we think would be useful to the user of our application to identify the most important markets.

A limitation we identified is that we cannot show more specific information about the video games companies, this is an unfortunate constraint of the data set, which only has general information about markets. Collecting specific data from companies would be helpful to expand the metrics we are able to implement in our dashboard.

In particular, we found the front-end feedback received from our classmates to be very helpful. We did not receive TA feedback but based on the peer review, we found out that our first version of the app had some features in the layout of the dashboard that users found difficult to understand. For example, the tool-tips information and the functionality of some buttons in the control panel was not clear due to the lack of titles and labels. We have addressed this feedback in the current Milestone and we believe that these changes have improved the user's experience of the app.

Finally, we were able to replicate the same back-end functionality for  DashR and DashPy. The only difference between these apps is in the front-end. In DashR, we considered that a menu at the top of the app with all the widgets would allow a better user experience, so we implemented that in Milestone 4.

Overall, we believe that our app serves its purpose well in being a useful tool for newcomers to the video game market.
